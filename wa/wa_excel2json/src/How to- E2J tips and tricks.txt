## Answer Text Formatting

The simple answer python script will make these reformats to the answer text:

1) A cell with line breaks in it will have those linebreaks replaced by <br/> tags.

2) Any line that starts with a dash followed by a space will become a dot point within a <ul> tag.

3) Any html tags in the answer are left as is.  If you need to display html verbatum in your answer
you will need to have the open angle brackets as "&lt;" within the answer cell.


## Remembering Context

For broad intents diferentiated by entities to give different specific answers, the dialog structure
is set up to remember the last intent if the user just mentions an entity.  For example, based on a
broad intent called "Definition":

User: What is legislation?
Watson: Legislation means etc.. etc...
User: persecution?
Watson: Persecution means etc.. etc...

Broad intents are set up in the answer spreadsheet by having the same intent on multiple rows, with
all the rows having a different entity value, except for the final row which gives the general answer
or the intent.
